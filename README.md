Scientific Question: Are there differing mutations in oncogenic Ras isoform genes, specifically neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog, Harvey rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog, and Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog, within urothelial carcinomas and are these mutations a sufficient enough biomarker to characterize this type of cancer?

Scientific Hypothesis: If urothelial carcinomas contain differing amounts of oncogenic Ras isoforms NRAS, HRAS, and KRAS expression, then these mutations could be used as biomarkers to classify this type of cancer.

You will need a few files in order to adequately run the code:

1) This R notebook.
2) NRAS proto-oncogene
3) KRAS proto-oncogene
4) HRAS proto-oncogene
